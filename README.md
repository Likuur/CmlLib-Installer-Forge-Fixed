# CmlLib.Core.Installer.Forge

Fixed version of the library CmlLib.Core.Installer.Forge. Now when running Minecraft with Forge no exceptions will be thrown!
The source code of CmlLib.Core.Installer.Forge library was taken from source [this.](https://github.com/CmlLib/CmlLib.Core.Installer.Forge)

# No exeptions

I fixed the DLL so that now no exceptions will fly out when trying to run Minecraft with Forge.
